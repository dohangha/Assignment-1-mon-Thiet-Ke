    Nothing matters more in brief writing than structure and organization. This course helps
    attorneys improve their organization by examining how leading advocates structure their
    writing. Themes, headings, and topic sentences form the three essential components of a
    well-organized brief. After exploring what makes each component effective, the learner
    then works through a series of exercises to determine the best fit for each brief. As they
    progress, the learner improves their strategy for writing better organized briefs\u2014and
    hopefully has fun engaging with some truly fantastic legal writing!

and compiling signature pages for the myriad of documents needed for the signing or closing of

through the cracks. For those new to deal work, managing signature pages can feel like an overwhelming
