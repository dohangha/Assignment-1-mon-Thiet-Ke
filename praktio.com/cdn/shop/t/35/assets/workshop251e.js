    This multi-part bootcamp is a fantastic way to help your newly arrived transactional
    associates get off to a great start at your firm. The first part focuses on deal context,
    including a high-level view of the lifecycle of a deal, an interactive session on taking
    ownership, and an active listening activity centered around learning the goals, concerns, and
    preferences of stakeholders on a deal. Part 2 teaches a framework for reviewing and drafting
    contracts, including how to take a multi-pass approach to reviewing a contract and common
    concerns for drafting a contract (e.g., clarity, tone, measurability). Part 3 takes a deeper
    dive into contract drafting, with a primer on the anatomy of contracts and drafting best
    practices and an in-depth simulation exercise for practicing drafting a contract in a
    hypothetical deal scenario. Lastly, part 4 teaches negotiation strategies and tactics,
    including an in-depth simulation where participants practice negotiating a contract with
    another team, in the context of the same hypothetical deal scenario from part 3.

	Law firms often report finding it challenging to provide summer associates with accessible transactional projects 
	that give them realistic transactional experience over a summer. This workshop provides a great way to supplement 
	any summer program, with hands-on opportunities for summers to practice contract drafting and negotiation in the context 
	of a realistic transaction. It also provides summers with a chance to work in small teams with other summers at the firm 
	and, if desired, receive feedback from lawyers at the firm.

	This workshop is a great way to get summer associates excited about taking on some transactional matters, by helping them 
	concretely understand what transactional work is and what transactional lawyers do. We start off by exploring the proactive 
	lawyering mindset of transactional lawyers that law school classes often leave unexamined (i.e., "How can I best position my 
	client to avoid a dispute, while accomplishing their business goals?"). From there, we discuss how deal lawyers use precedent 
	materials, prior experiences, and colleagues to do their work. This workshop then provides a high-level outline of a typical 
	deal timeline to give the participants a full picture view of the phases, tasks, and responsibilities of a deal from start to 
	close. Lastly, the participants work through a short contract drafting exercise in small teams, which we debrief as a full group.

	Effective contract drafting requires anticipating all the potential ways the same language might be reasonably read, 
	especially by a counterparty opportunistically arguing the language means something contrary to your client's interests 
	sometime in the future. This workshop teaches common drafting pitfalls that leave room for multiple interpretations 
	(i.e., ambiguity) and how to draft to avoid them. We explore a series of examples and explanations, followed by a series of
	exercises where participants work (individually or in small teams) to identify pitfalls in contract excerpts and to revise
	with the intent of forestalling potential, adverse interpretations. For each exercise, we'll reconvene as a full group to 
	walk through the exercise, identify the main pitfalls in the language, and demonstrate potential drafting solutions to avoid 
	the issue. This way, participants get the benefit of working through the problems (e.g., with their peers to see how they 
	might read the same language differently), while making sure to walk away from each exercise with the key drafting lessons 
	to take with them into practice.

	Transactional attorneys often fall into the trap of debating the finer details of a provision's language before trying to 
	discern each side's underlying objectives ("interests" in negotiation parlance). This can give the illusion of impasse and 
	lead down a combative, unproductive path. This workshop teaches how to focus on interests to find potential solutions 
	(including linking provisions and trading concessions each side cares more about) prior to fine-tuning language, through a 
	seminar and a realistic, simulative exercise.

	Conducting an internal investigation is a unique task that implicates different skills, ethical considerations, and strategic 
	choices than typical litigation matters. It can be particularly challenging for junior associates to understand how 
	investigations progress, pitfalls that may exist, and what their roles may be\u2013challenges that are often exacerbated by the 
	fact that many investigations move at a swift pace. This workshop provides a high-level understanding of types of internal 
	investigations, how investigations may progress, and potential outcomes to help associates see around corners. It teaches 
	associates how to provide value through common tasks, including drafting an investigation plan, designing document review 
	protocols, requesting necessary policies and handbooks from the client, considering digital forensic nuances, preparing 
	interview outlines, and protecting privilege, especially if the investigation may result in sharing information with law 
	enforcement.

	Understanding how to find, preserve, or analyze electronic information can be the key to unlocking many legal matters, 
	including by determining whether private customer data was compromised, proving that a former employee stole valuable trade 
	secrets, conducting an internal investigation, assessing a potential spoliation claim, or evaluating an M&A transaction. 
	Additionally, learning basic terminology about digital forensics can help lawyers more effectively and efficiently 
	communicate with the court, experts, vendors, and a client\u2019s information security or data collection teams. Drawing upon 
	the instructor\u2019s litigation and experience as well as certifications for computer forensics and IT fundamentals, this 
	workshop outlines basic digital forensic concepts, in approachable terms, to prepare lawyers to more effectively understand, 
	identify, preserve, collect, and use data.

	The old adage is that law school teaches students how to think. However, thinking (and acting) like a practicing lawyer 
	requires a perspective shift and understanding of the practical realities of how matters begin, are managed, and progress 
	that differs from skills honed in law school. This training focuses on empowering junior lawyers to transition from law 
	students to litigation associates by providing practical guidance relating to client management, case management, and going 
	to court, as well as how to shift from the role of legal researcher to persuasive advocate, including a required tonal shift 
	that many junior lawyers struggle to implement in their writing. The training also discusses common questions that junior 
	associates face with their day-to-day jobs, including what tasks are appropriate to delegate to paralegals, how to manage 
	overlapping deadlines for multiple managers, when to stop researching a legal issue, and how to manage time expectations for 
	assignments.

	A common question that new associates ask their mentors is: how do I add value to my cases? To be a valuable associate takes 
	more than just having great technical, legal skills, and associates that can add value across multiple facets of a matter 
	create better outcomes for clients and better experiences for the legal team. This training provides practical tips for how 
	associates can improve case management and make senior associates and partners want to staff them repeatedly. Skills taught 
	in this workshop include how to thoughtfully organize case materials, how to ask effective questions, how to present research 
	findings to senior associates and partners, and how to start on a task the associate has never done before.

	Junior associates become mid-level and senior associates typically based on their technical legal prowess, but those new roles 
	require additional case, time, and team management skills. This training focuses on managerial skills, including how to set 
	expectations when working with new associates, considerations for staffing teams, when and how to delegate, how to equip 
	junior associates to successfully complete assignments, how to provide constructive feedback, how to \u201Cmanage up,\u201D and how to

	What is a trade secret? This is a question that litigators, white collar investigators, and corporate lawyers all should be 
	able to answer at a basic level. In fact, understanding the answer to this question, which is more nuanced than many lawyers 
	realize, and which can differ between jurisdictions in the U.S. as well as in foreign countries, can impact various legal 
	issues\u2014including (to name a few) whether a company has the right to sue a former employee or competitor who steals valuable 
	corporate information, what data can and should be exchanged during discovery, how to structure internal investigations, 
	questions to consider during an M&A transition, and how companies should draft NDAs, employment agreements, confidentiality 
	policies, and corporate handbooks. This training provides an overview of trade secret law, common misconceptions about trade 
	secrets, and current legal issues lawyers should be aware of relating to trade secrets.

	This workshop arms lawyers with specific tools to provide trauma-informed legal services and to help reduce retraumatizing 
	clients exposed to trauma. The workshop also discusses ways lawyers can increase their cultural competency, including 
	considering transportation restraints or communication styles and mechanisms, to bolster the relationship with clients of 
	diverse socioeconomic, ethic, cultural, or religious backgrounds. Additionally, the workshop empowers lawyers to safeguard 
	their own health and well-being both in their practice generally and when there is a risk of secondary trauma from working 
	with clients with trauma exposure.

	This workshop starts off by teaching first-year transactional associates about the big picture of deals generally, exploring the key documents, 
    tasks, and roles of the typical workflows of a deal. From there, we zoom into the anatomy of contracts, introducing an organizational schema for
    understanding the structure of any contract and examining salient "building block" provisions that commonly come up for transactional first years.
    Lastly, we tick through drafting mechanics (e.g., definitions, section references), along with best practices and pitfalls, calibrated for
    issues that often arise for transactional first years.

	These hands-on workshops situate contract drafting in the context of broader negotiation strategy. The first part focuses on strategically drafting
    and marking up contracts to serve your client's negotiation goals. The second part focuses on negotiating effectively in live voices to close
    the gaps in a contract, while accomplishing your client's desired outcomes. In both parts, participants will work in small teams on practical exercises
    and discuss takeaway lessons as a full group.

	This workshop zooms in on that moment when a transactional attorney receives a contract draft from a junior colleague, focusing on the twin goals 
    of (1) providing useful feedback to support the junior's development and (2) improving the draft to be ready to ship to its next destination
    (be that a partner, a client, or elsewhere). Together, we discern what the most useful feedback for juniors looks like and
    the most common drafting issues the participants see in the junior work product they review. We discuss ways to empower juniors, while meeting
    stakeholder expectations. This hands-on workshop includes an immersive exercise, where participants work in small teams in a hypothetical scenario
    to review a junior's markup that attempts to address new client information. Exercise teams edit the draft to ready it for delivery and provide feedback to their
    junior colleague to improve their drafting skills.
